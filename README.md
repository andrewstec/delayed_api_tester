Based on Redis data, perform a MongoDB query, and relay information to API

This saved the day today, and I was not sure what to do with the code. It would be a shame to let it go to waste. 

Here is a script to take Redis information, perform a MongoDb query based off of it, and then, finally, perform an API call.
